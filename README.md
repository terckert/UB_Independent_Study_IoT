# Independent Study 
## Project 1: Controlling a microcontroller using BT

This repository hosts the website I wrote to show off independent study progress during my senior year at UB. [It is available to view here.](https://terckert.github.io/UB_Independent_Study_IoT/)

[The microcontroller code can be found in the repository here.](https://github.com/terckert/Independent_Study_Project_1) Originally, I was exploring programming it from the ground up using baremetal drivers. It was a great learning experience and it made me appreciate having access to the HAL, which I switched to to complete the project because of pressure from other classes. Programmed using C/C++ for a STMF411RE microcontroller.

[Finally, the UI control can be found here.](https://github.com/terckert/bluetooth-game-gui/blob/master/gui.py) It is written in python using Eel, an electron like library. Eel allowed me to easily program a GUI that would worked on linux using HTML, CSS, Javascript, and Python.
