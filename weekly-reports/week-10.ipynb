    "### Project progress\n",
    "A lot of the basic functionality was completed previous as far as the board was concerned. This week, I adding the logic necessary to make the game of \"Lights Out\" using the matrix LED I created previously.\n",
    "\n",
    "On top of that I created a GUI using the Eel Python package. This package is best described as \"Electron-lite\". It allowed me to create the GUI using HTML, CSS, and JS with a Python backend to handle OS level requests that the browser sandbox restricts.\n",

    "![Screenshot of UI the only time I won the game.](./gui-screenshot.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "The above screenshot is the only time I was able to successfully complete the game. The goal is to start from a random board and turn on all the lights. I may have to switch it to a 5x5 grid in the future because most examples use the *odd* x *odd* style grid. \n",
    "\n",
    "Click on a light in the GUI will swap it from on to off and vice versa, as well as the toggle the lights directly north, east, south, and west.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Next steps\n",
    "I need to clean up my github and consolidate the files as is. A better name would be helpful. I am going to call this project done because I want to move onto using my web modules.\n"
