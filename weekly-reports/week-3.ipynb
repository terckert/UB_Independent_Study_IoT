    "### The UART protocol: What is it?\n",
    "Stands for __Universal Asynchronous Receiver/Transmitter__\n",
    "\n",
    "There are two types of communication structuress:\n",
    "1. __Parallel__: 8-bit data is transfered at the same time \n",
    "2. __Serial__: 8-bit data is transferred one bit at a time\n",
    "\n",
    "Uart is serial. Serial data communication uses two methods:\n",
    "- __Synchronous__: Clock is transmitted with the data\n",
    "- __Asynchronous__: No clock is transmitted. Transmitter and receiver agree on the clock speed for the data transmission (baudrate)\n",
    "\n",
    "Putting it all together:\n",
    "\n",
    "__UART__\n",
    "- Universal Asynchonous Receiver/Transmitter\n",
    "- Serial connection\n",
    "- Baudrate has to be the same on both receiver and transmitter\n",
    "\n",
    "__USART__\n",
    "- Universal Synchronous Asynchronous Receiver/Transmitter\n",
    "- Serial Connection\n",
    "- Clock (baudrate) is transmitted with the data or agreed on by the receiver and transmitter. Both options are available.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Transmission modes\n",
    "\n",
    "<img style=\"float:right;padding-left:5px;\" src=\"data-transmission-modes.png\">\n",
    "\n",
    "__Duplex__: Data can be transmitted and received<br><br><br>\n",
    "__Simplex__: Data can be transmitted only or received only. Only one direction<br><br><br><br>\n",
    "__Half Duplex__: Data can be transmitted in only one direction at a time<br><br><br><br><br>\n",
    "__Full Duplex__: Data can be transmitted in both ways at a time<br><br><br><br>\n",
    "\n",
    "In synchronous transmission, each byte (character) is packed between start and stop bits. The start bit is always 1 bit and the value of the start bit is always 0. Stop bit can be 1 or 2 bits and the value of the stop bit is always 1.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Configuration parameters\n",
    "__Baudrate__\n",
    "- Connection speed expressed in bits per second.\n",
    "\n",
    "__Stop Bit__\n",
    "- Number of stop bits transmitted, can be one or two bits in length.\n",
    "\n",
    "__Parity__\n",
    "- Indicates the parity mode, whether odd or even. Used for error checking.\n",
    "\n",
    "__Mode__\n",
    "- Specifies whether RX or TX mode is enabled or disabled.\n",
    "- Related to the transmission mode\n",
    "\n",
    "__Word Length__\n",
    "- Specifies the number of data bits transmitted or received. \n",
    "- Can be 8-bits or 9-bits.\n",
    "  \n",
    "__Hardware Flow Control__\n",
    "- Specifies whether *Hardware Flow Control* is enabled or disabled.\n",
    "- In data communications, flow control is the process of managing the rate of data transmission between two nodes to prevent a fast sender from overwhelming a slow receiver. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Additional UART information\n",
    "*source*![Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universal_asynchronous_receiver-transmitter)\n",
    "\n",
    "For UART to work, the following settings need to be the same on about the transmitting and receiving side: baud rate, parity bit, data bits size, stop bits size, flow control (*see configuration options above*)\n",
    "\n",
    "A uart idle signal is continuous high. Switching to logic low indicates that data is being transmitted.\n",
    "\n",
    "The uart frame consists of 5 elements:\n",
    "1. Start bit\n",
    "   - Signals the receiver that a new bit is coming (logic low)\n",
    "2. Data bit\n",
    "   - The next five to nine bits, depending on code set employed, respresent the character\n",
    "3. Parity bit\n",
    "   - If a parity bit is being used it is placed after the data\n",
    "   - It can be even or odd, but it has to be agreed on by the sender and receiver\n",
    "4. Stop bit\n",
    "   - The next one or two bits are always in the mark (logic high). The signal that the character is complete.\n",
    "   - since the start bit is low and the stop bit(s) are high there are always at least two guaranteed signal changes between the characters.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is a standard feature for a UART to store the most recent character while receiving the nex. This form of \"double buffering\" gives a receiving computer an entire character transmission time to fetch the received character. Many UARTs have a small FIFO buffer memory allowing them to buffer even more transmissions. Transmitters likewise usually have a buffer, allowing them to buffer characters for transmission (since transmission rate is usually slower than processor speed).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Special transceiver conditions and errors\n",
    "__Overrun Error__\n",
    "<br> Occurs when the receiver cannot process data as quickly as it is being received.\n",
    "\n",
    "__Underrun Error__\n",
    "<br> Occurs when the UART transmitter has completed sending a character and the transmit buffer is empty. In asynchronous mode, it is treated as if there is no more data to trasnmit and additional stop bits can be appended. In synchronous mode, it is treated as an error since it more serious in this transmission mode.\n",
    "\n",
    "__Framing Error__\n",
    "<br> When a stop bit is not received at the expected time. If the stop bit is not in the expected high state when a start bit is received, the UART will signal a framing error. A \"break\" condition on the line is also signaled as a framing error (?).\n",
    "\n",
    "__Parity Error__\n",
    "<br> Occurs when the parity bit is incorrect. This can only be thrown when parity-bit checking has been enabled.\n",
    "\n",
    "__Break Condition__\n",
    "<br> Occurs when the the receiver input is as at low for a too long period of time (typically one character lengths period). It is not necessarily an error, but appears to the receiver as a character of all zero-bits with a framing error.\n",
