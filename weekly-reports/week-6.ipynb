    "What I accomplished this week...\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "Well, it's been quite the week this week. I would say it was the most intellectually productive and taxing week since week 2.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Matrix LED\n",
    "An idea born of Anthony Roberts. I didn't consider the possibility of limiting the number of wires needed for a system of LEDs until it was brought up. It took a few hours of time and of research for me to understand the concept and get a working prototype on a breadboard. Of course, I did it the most horrible and cramped way possible the first time. Luckily, google images showed me nicer ways of laying it out on a breadboard. \n",
    "\n",
    "The concept, once understood, is simple and saves on the number of ports needed to control large numbers of LEDS. In my case, with a 4x4 grid I only need 8 wires to control 16 bults (l+w wires for l*w bulbs);\n",
    "1. All anodes in a row or column are tied to the same power source (in my case, output register with a pull up resistor). Importantly, tie a resistor into this line to prevent burning out any bulbs.\n",
    "2. All cathodes in a row or column are tied to the same ground (or in my case, output register with a pull down resistor).\n",
    "3. If you're anode column dominant (in my case), light it quickly column by column to give the illusion of a continuous light source.\n",
    "4. Control the drain sources to determine which bulbs are lit.\n",
    "   - Between column power cycles (all columns off), I change the values in the rows (1 for off, 0 for on)\n",
    "\n",
    "![Matrix LED Schematic](./Matrix_LED.drawio.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "I was able to create some cool patterns and sync it to Cardi B (the voice of a generation!) using the above schematic and some coding no how! \n",
    "\n",
    "### MbedOS\n",
    "Since I'm now incorporating a matrix LED and want it to always be be cycling, I decided that I needed to move the project from baremetal into an RTOS. To that end, I spent a lot of time rewriting my code once more to incorporate RTOS features and organize it into C++ style code. I want the flexibility of C++ and the threading and scheduling features built into it. Since I already dove into the nuts and bolts of baremetal setup and had working prototypes, I don't feel bad about the change.\n",
    "\n",
    "Some of the major project changes:\n",
    "- Custom packet structure communication\n",
    "  - Each packet is 64 bytes\n",
    "  - First 4 bytes are the type of packet\n",
    "  - Second 4 bytes are current packet number\n",
    "  - Third 4 bytes are how many total packets in the message\n",
    "    - Allows packets to exceed length limit but introduces complexity in tracking packet counts\n",
    "  - Remaining 52 bytes are data bytes\n",
    "    - Data can be further modified by packet type, ex. GAMEMOVE packet is only 1 integer that says which bulb it's toggling\n",
    "- Instead of a circular buffer that is 256 bytes long, I now use a circular packet buffer\n",
    "  - 2D array, ```char buffer[10][64];```\n",
    "  - Using a character buffer to make casting and writing it easier (void * sucks!)\n",
    "  - Has an outer and inner head\n",
    "  - Has an outer tail\n",
    "  - Since all packets are 64 bytes in length, I read 64 bytes and move outer head to next outer index\n",
    "  - The inner head helps me read in and store the bytes in the individual packets\n",
    "- Buffer has data when head != tail\n",
    "\n",
    "I had to install mbed Studio, which isn't natively supported on my flavor of linux. I need to use the following command to get it to run:\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "$ mbed-studio --no-sandbox\n",
    "```\n",
    "### HC-05 drawbacks\n",
    "While debugging interactions between my python frontend and embedded backend I noticed that python wasn't receiving the packets as I originally designed them and it was causing issues. Minus the overhead of a bluetooth packet, it seems that the most data I can trasnmit in a single bluetooth packet is about 106 bytes, so that requires that I rewrite a lot of python functionality (I originally planned on 128 byte packets). I'm not sure if it's due to my BT module or python. It says the maximum for BT3 is about 1KB packet size, but I am not finding it to be so.\n",

    "### Conclusion\n",
    "I am on track to be completed with project one before April. This will leave me all of April to explore WiFi on embedded devices. I'm excited by this and want to discuss a possible second project with Dr. Schindler. The only downside being that I might not be able to complete it in time, but would allow me to delve deep into embedded system design."
